# Get page lead forms

```http
GET /ad-publishing/facebook/page/:pageId/forms
```

Retrieve lead gen forms for a specific Facebook page (published + drafts), sorted newest-first by `createdTime`. By default each form is returned in full (including its `questions`) as a plain array; pass `projection` (comma-separated) to return only the requested fields — any value outside the known field set is rejected. Pass `limit` (max 100) for a `{ forms, paging }` envelope; use `after` (from `paging.next`) to fetch the next batch.

## Request

### Header parameters

- **Version** `string` _required_ — API Version
  - Available options: `v3`

### Path parameters

- **pageId** `string` _required_ — Facebook page identifier

### Query parameters

- **locationId** `string` _required_ — Location identifier
- **projection** `string[]` — Fields to return on each lead form, comma-separated (e.g. ?projection=name,id,pageId,status,isDraft,createdTime). When set, only the requested fields are returned; any other value is rejected. Omit to receive the full form (including questions) as-is.
  - Available options: `id`, `name`, `pageId`, `status`, `isDraft`, `createdTime`, `locale`, `page`, `questions`
- **limit** `string` — Page size for a paginated fetch (max 100). When set, the response is a { forms, paging } envelope instead of a plain array.
- **after** `string` — Opaque cursor for the next batch, taken from the previous response paging.next

### Response (200 · application/json)

A plain array of lead forms (default), or a { forms, paging } envelope when `limit` is provided. Each entry is either a form published to Facebook or an unpublished local draft — the two shapes differ, and `isDraft` tells them apart. Supplying `projection` narrows every entry to the requested fields only.

**Schema**

oneOf

Array [

oneOf

- **id** `string` — Facebook lead form id
- **name** `string` — Form name
- **locale** `string` — Form locale, lower-cased by Facebook. Note drafts report the same locale upper-cased.
- **status** `string` — Form status. Always `ACTIVE` in this list — the upstream query filters the others out.
- **createdTime** `string` — Creation time in the Facebook timestamp format (`+0000` offset, no sub-second precision). Drafts use ISO-8601 with milliseconds instead, so a client parsing this field must accept both.
- **page** `object` — Page the form belongs to
- **pageId** `string` — Page id, repeated from `page.id`
- **questions** `object[]` — Questions on the form
