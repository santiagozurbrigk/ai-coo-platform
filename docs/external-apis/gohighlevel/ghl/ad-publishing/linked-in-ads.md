- [Get lead forms](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/ad-publishing/li-get-lead-forms) — Retrieve LinkedIn lead gen forms for an ad account.

When `limit` is provided (max 100) the response is a paginated `{ leadForms, paging }` envelope; pass `pageToken` (from `paging.next`) to fetch the next batch.
