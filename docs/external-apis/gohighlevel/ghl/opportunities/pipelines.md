# Pipelines

Documentation for Opportunities API

- [Get Pipelines](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/opportunities/get-pipelines)
- [Create Pipeline](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/opportunities/create-pipeline) — Creates a new pipeline with at least one stage for a given location. Pipeline names must be unique per location (case-insensitive), and stage names must be unique within the pipeline. To enable manual win probability, set `useOpportunityProbability` to `true` and provide a `stageWinProbability` (0–100) on every stage — if any stage is missing a value, the system falls back to auto-computed probabilities based on stage position.
- [Get Pipeline](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/opportunities/get-pipeline) — Retrieves a single pipeline by its ID, including all its stages and configuration.
- [Update Pipeline](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/opportunities/update-pipeline) — Updates an existing pipeline. The `stages` array is a full replacement — include the `id` field on existing stages to retain them, or omit it to create a new stage. You cannot remove all stages at once. Any opportunities in removed stages are automatically migrated to the lowest-position remaining stage. Pipeline and stage names must remain unique (case-insensitive) within the location.

- [Delete Pipeline](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/opportunities/delete-pipeline) — Permanently deletes a pipeline and all opportunities within it. This action is irreversible — all opportunities across every stage of this pipeline will be removed. Ensure you have migrated or exported any opportunities before calling this endpoint.
