# Execute Agent (Deprecated)

```http
POST /agent-studio/public-api/agents/:agentId/execute
```

> deprecated
>
> This endpoint has been deprecated and may be replaced or removed in future versions of the API.
>

**Deprecated endpoint - use POST /agent/ :agentId /execute instead.**

Executes the specified agent and returns a non-streaming JSON response with the complete agent output. The agent must be in active status and belong to the specified location. locationId is required in the request body.

**Session Management:**

- For the first message in a new session, do not include the `executionId` in the request payload.
- The API will return an `executionId` along with the agent response, which uniquely identifies this conversation session.
- To continue the conversation within the same session, include the `executionId` from the previous response in subsequent requests.
