### URL Pattern

```text
/app-settings/{your-app-id}/dashboard/logs
```

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Statistics Cards

The dashboard displays three key metrics at the top of the page. **Important:** These statistics show data for the **last 24 hours** and are **independent of your date range filters**.

#### Total Events

- Shows the number of unique events received during the selected period
- Includes both successful and failed webhooks
- Updates based on your selected date range and filters
- Deduplicates by webhook ID

#### Consumer Errors

- Displays webhooks that failed (non-2xx status codes)
- High numbers indicate potential issues with your webhook endpoint

#### Total Attempts

- Shows all delivery attempts including retries
- If this number is higher than Total Events, your app is experiencing retries
- Helps identify webhook delivery issues

**NOTE**: For **any non-`2xx` response** and for transport failures with no HTTP response, we retry up to **12 times** (excluding the original attempt) using exponential backoff with jitter. For detailed retry policy information, see the [Error Handling and Retries](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/WebhookIntegrationGuide#error-handling-and-retries) section.

### Logs Table

The logs table displays the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Event Name** | Type of webhook event | `ContactCreate`, `INSTALL` |
| **Webhook ID** | Unique identifier for tracking | `abc123def456...` |
| **Attempted At** | When the webhook was sent | `2024-11-13 14:30:45` |
| **Status Code** | HTTP response status | `200` (success) or `404` (error) |
| **Attempt #** | Delivery attempt number. Automatic retries are numbered sequentially (`1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, etc.). Developer-triggered retries are displayed as **`-`**. | `1st`, `2nd`, `-` |

Status codes are color-coded: green for success (2xx) and red for errors (all others).

## Using Date & Time Filters

### Date & Time Pickers

- By default, the logs display the **last 1 hour** of webhook activity
- You can change the date range with up to 1 second accuracy for any period within the past 30 days
- The date pickers provide quick shortcuts:
  - **Today**: Jump to today's date
  - **Last 7 Days**: View the past week
  - **Last 30 Days**: View the past month (maximum range)

**NOTE**: Logs are retained for the last 30 days

### Changing Timezone

All webhook times are stored in UTC, but you can view them in your local timezone for easier reading.

#### How to Change Timezone

1. Locate the **timezone dropdown** on the right

2. Click and start typing your timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")

3. Select your timezone from the list

4. All times will instantly convert to your selected timezone

#### Timezone Features

- Your selection is saved automatically
- All times in the table update immediately
- Modal details also display in your selected timezone
- Search for timezones by typing

**Example**:

- UTC: `2024-11-13 14:30:00`
- Eastern Time: `2024-11-13 09:30:00`

## Searching Logs

### Global Search Bar

The search bar is located in the top-left of the table and allows you to search for specific webhooks.

#### What You Can Search

- **Webhook ID**: Enter the full or partial webhook ID
- **Webhook Payloads**: Enter the value or full key-value pair to search in the payload

#### How to Search

1. Click in the search box

2. To search by webhook ID: Type your webhook ID (e.g., `abc123....`)

3. To search by payload: Enter the value or full key-value pair from the payload Example payload:

```json
{
  "type": "OpportunityCreate",
  "locationId": "3jJ0coeqWCZMAosyGQ6K",
  "versionId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9",
  "appId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9",
  "id": "UHXrFfZGSH5rj7z5rdDP",
  "name": "Test 2",
  "assignedTo": null,
  "contactId": "VQxH1EeoFPg9uhhnCeJx",
  "pipelineId": "WQ7tyljQSXAg7GuTgYdd",
  "pipelineStageId": "403af14e-9afb-40b1-b394-0aa6bbe0cc5e",

  "webhookId": "881b9415-5d35-4ff1-a667-0545b80b96c0"
}
```

  - Any substring of value **will work**. ex - `FPg9uhhnCe` (substring from contactId)
  - Any one key-value pair **will work**. ex - `"contactId": "VQxH1EeoFPg9uhhnCeJx"` or `name: Test 2` (quotes not important)
  - random substring of json **will not work**. ex - `sionId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9", "appId": "6878cec452e7c`
  - multiple key values **will not work**. ex - `"appId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9", "id": "UHXrFfZGSH5rj7z5rdDP"`

4. Results will update automatically

## Viewing Webhook Details

### Opening the Details Modal

1. Click on **any row** in the logs table

2. The **Webhook event details** modal will appear with full delivery information

### What You'll See

#### Webhook URL

- The endpoint where the webhook was sent
- **Copy button**: Click to copy the URL to your clipboard
- Useful for verifying the correct endpoint

#### Event Information

- **Event Name**: Type of webhook (e.g., `ContactCreate`)
- **Webhook ID**: Unique identifier for this webhook
- **Attempt #**: Which delivery attempt (`1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, etc.). Automatic retries may show a badge such as **Resent automatically** in the modal
- **Attempted At**: When it was sent (in your selected timezone)
- **Triggering Event**: What caused this webhook

#### Payload

- **JSON data** sent with the webhook
- Automatically formatted for easy reading
- **Copy button**: Click to copy the entire payload
- **Resend button**: Manually redeliver the webhook when enabled (see [Triggering a Manual Retry](#triggering-a-manual-retry))
- Useful for:
  - Debugging issues
  - Understanding data structure
  - Testing with sample data

### Using the Payload

#### Copy or resend the payload

- **Copy**: Click to copy the JSON payload to your clipboard for debugging or local testing
- **Resend**: Click to manually redeliver the webhook when the button is enabled (see [When Is Resend Available?](#when-is-resend-available))

## Triggering a Manual Retry

When a webhook delivery has failed and you want to redeliver it, you can trigger a manual retry directly from the dashboard.

### How It Works

1. In the logs table, find the **latest failed** row for the webhook you want to redeliver (filter by failure or search by Webhook ID if needed)

2. Click the row to open the **Webhook event details** modal

3. In the **Payload** section, click **Resend** (enabled only for the latest failed attempt that has not already succeeded)

4. The original payload is re-sent to your webhook URL

5. A new row appears in the table with Attempt # **`-`**

### When Is Resend Available?

The **Resend** button is enabled only when:

- You are viewing the **latest attempt** for that webhook ID
- The webhook has **not** already been delivered successfully

If **Resend** is disabled, open the most recent row for that Webhook ID (an older attempt may have been superseded), or check whether a later attempt already succeeded.

### What Happens After a Manual Retry?

- **If it succeeds:** The webhook is marked as delivered and any remaining scheduled retry is cancelled
- **If it fails:** The failure is logged. The manual attempt does not start its own automatic retry cycle, but any **scheduled automatic retries for the original failure continue**. You can use **Resend** again after fixing the issue

## Clearing All Filters

### When to Clear Filters

- You've applied multiple filters and want to start fresh
- You're not seeing expected results
- You want to view all webhooks in the date range

### How to Clear

1. Locate the **"Clear Filters"** button (top-left, blue text with refresh icon)

2. Click the button

3. All filters are removed instantly

### What Gets Cleared

- Search text
- Event name filters (sort, conditions, selected values)
- Status code filters (sort, selected values)
- Pagination resets to page 1

### What Stays

- Date & time range (not cleared)
- Timezone selection (not cleared)

**Note**: The button is only enabled when you have active filters.

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Finding a Specific Webhook

**Scenario**: Support provided a webhook ID to investigate

**Steps**:

1. Copy the webhook ID

2. Paste it in the **search bar**

3. Press Enter or wait for auto-search

4. Click the row to see full details

### Use Case 2: Troubleshooting Failed Webhooks

**Scenario**: Your app isn't receiving webhooks properly

**Steps**:

1. Open **Status Code filter**

2. Click **"Filter By Failure"**

3. Click **"Apply"**

4. Review the failed webhooks

5. Click rows to see error codes and payloads

6. Look for patterns:

  - All 404? Your endpoint URL might be wrong
  - All 401? Check authentication
  - All 500? Your server has errors

### Use Case 3: Checking Retry Behavior

**Scenario**: You want to see if webhooks are being retried

**Steps**:

1. Look at the **"Attempt #"** column

2. Search for a specific **Webhook ID** that appears multiple times

3. Look for entries like `2nd`, `3rd`, `4th`, or `-` (developer-triggered resend)

4. High attempt numbers indicate persistent failures

5. Click to view details and see what changed between attempts

### Use Case 4: Monitoring Event Volume

**Scenario**: You want to know how many webhooks you're receiving

**Steps**:

1. Set date range to **"Last 7 Days"** or **"Last 30 Days"**

2. Look at **"Total Events"** statistic

3. Compare to **"Total Attempts"**

4. High difference indicates many retries happening

5. Check **"Consumer Errors"** to see failure rate

### Use Case 5: Focusing on Specific Events

**Scenario**: You only care about contact-related webhooks

**Steps**:

1. Open **Event Name filter**

2. Click **"Filter by Values"**

3. Type **"CONTACT"** in the search box

4. Select all contact events:

  - `ContactCreate`
  - `ContactUpdate`
  - `ContactDelete`

5. Click **"Apply"**

6. Now you only see contact webhooks

### Use Case 6: Investigating Issues at Specific Time

**Scenario**: Your app had issues yesterday at 2 PM

**Steps**:

1. Select your **timezone** first

2. Set **start date/time** to yesterday 2:00 PM

3. Set **end date/time** to yesterday 3:00 PM

4. Open **Status Code filter**

5. Click **"Filter By Failure"**

6. Review what went wrong during that hour

### Use Case 7: Comparing Success vs Failure

**Scenario**: You want to see the success rate

**Steps**:

1. Note **"Total Events"** number

2. Note **"Consumer Errors"** number

3. Calculate: (Total Events - Consumer Errors) / Total Events × 100

4. Example: (1000 - 50) / 1000 = 95% success rate

5. Filter by failures to investigate the remaining percentage

### Use Case 8: Post-Deployment Verification

**Scenario**: You just deployed a webhook fix

**Steps**:

1. Note the **deployment time** in your timezone

2. Set **start time** to deployment time

3. Set **end time** to now

4. Filter by the **event name** you fixed

5. Check **"Consumer Errors"** should be low/zero

6. Click rows to verify correct payloads

### Use Case 9: Manually Retrying a Failed Webhook

**Scenario**: Automatic retries failed but you've fixed the issue on your server

**Steps**:

1. Filter by **Status Code** → **Filter By Failure**

2. Find the **latest failed** row for the webhook (search by Webhook ID if needed)

3. Open the modal and confirm **Resend** is enabled

4. Click **Resend**

5. Verify the new row shows Attempt # **`-`** and a success status code

## FAQ

**Why is no data showing in the logs?**

**Check Your Date Range:**

- Make sure **start date is before end date**
- Invalid ranges show an error message
- Try using the **"Last 7 Days"** shortcut

**Check Your Filters:**

- Click **"Clear Filters"** button
- Remove any event name or status code filters
- Clear the search box

**Verify Webhooks Are Configured:**

- Go to your app's **Webhooks** settings
- Ensure webhook URLs are configured
- Check that events are subscribed

For detailed guide on setting up webhooks, please refer to the [Webhook Integration Guide](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/WebhookIntegrationGuide).

**Why don't the times look right?**

**Timezone Issue:**

- Check the **timezone selector**
- Select your correct timezone
- Times should update immediately

**Still Wrong?**

- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache
- Check if your system timezone is correct

**I can't find a specific webhook. What should I do?**

**Try Broader Search:**

- Use partial Webhook ID (first few characters)
- Expand your date range
- Remove other filters first

**Check Spelling:**

- Webhook IDs are case-sensitive in some systems
- Try copying and pasting exactly

**Why isn't my filter working?**

**Did You Click Apply?**

- Filters require clicking **"Apply"** button
- Just selecting options doesn't activate them

**Conflicting Filters:**

- Text conditions clear selected values
- Selected values clear text conditions
- Success/Failure sorts clear specific status code selections

**Try Clear and Reapply:**

- Click **"Clear"** in the filter dropdown
- Reapply your filter
- Click **"Apply"**

**I can't open the details modal. How do I fix this?**

**Row Not Clickable?**

- Make sure you're clicking the row, not just hovering
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try a different row

**Modal Shows Error:**

- The webhook detail might be unavailable
- Try refreshing the page
- Contact support if it persists

**Why isn't the copy button working?**

**Browser Permissions:**

- Modern browsers require HTTPS for clipboard
- Check if site is secure (padlock icon)
- Try allowing clipboard permissions in browser settings

**Manual Copy:**

- Select the text manually
- Right-click → Copy
- Or use Ctrl+C (Windows) / Cmd+C (Mac)

**Why don't the statistics match my expectations?**

**Statistics Respect Filters:**

- If you've filtered by event name, stats only show those events
- If you've filtered by failures, stats only show failed webhooks
- Click **"Clear Filters"** to see overall stats

**Date Range Matters:**

- Statistics only count webhooks in your selected date range
- Expand the date range to see more data

**What does - mean in the Attempt # column?**

It indicates a delivery attempt that was triggered by a developer using **Resend** in the dashboard, rather than by the automatic retry system.

**Why is the Resend button disabled?**

**Resend** is only enabled for the latest attempt of a webhook that has not been delivered successfully. If the button is disabled, open the most recent row for that Webhook ID, or check whether a later attempt already succeeded.

**Will a failed manual retry trigger more automatic retries?**

No additional automatic retries are started for the manual attempt itself. If a manual retry fails, **scheduled automatic retries for the original failure continue** as before. You can also use **Resend** again after resolving the issue.

**What happens to scheduled retries if my manual retry succeeds?**

Any remaining scheduled retry is automatically cancelled to prevent duplicate deliveries.
