# Marketplace App Distribution Model

This guide covers the new, simplified Marketplace distribution model and the OAuth flow you’ll need to implement to obtain the correct access tokens.

---

## App Distribution Model

To configure your desired app distribution model, you have three fields:

| Field | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Who is the target user of the app?** | `Agency` / `Sub-account` | Who is going to interact with the app? In other words, whose access token does the app ultimately need? For most apps, this will be `Sub-account` (Recommended). **Note:** This field cannot be modified once set. |
| **Who can install the app?** | `Both Agency and Sub-account` / `Agency Only` | Which user(s) may see and install the app from the Marketplace UI? Recommended: “Both Agency & Sub-account” for maximum reach. Use "Agency Only" for fully white-labelled SaaS features only agencies can discover and install. |
| **Can this app be bulk-installed by agencies?** | `Yes` / `No` | Primarily for backwards compatibility. All new Marketplace apps will be set to `Yes` (mandatory). Allows agency owners/admins to install to multiple sub-accounts in one operation. Cannot revert to `No` once set. |

## Distribution Scenarios

### Developer’s distribution config scenarios and getting the right access token

| Who is the target user? | Who can install the app? | Can the app be bulk-installed by agencies? | User Installation Scenarios | Access Token Details | Step 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agency | N/A | N/A | Agency user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : false`, `“userType” : ”Company”` | N/A |
| Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | No | Sub-account user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : false`, `“userType” : ”Location”` | N/A |
| Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | No | Agency user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : false`, `“userType" : "Location”` | N/A |
| Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | Yes | Sub-account user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : false`, `“userType" : "Location”` | N/A |
| Sub-account | Agency & sub-account | Yes | [NEW and RECOMMENDED] Agency user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : true`, `“userType" : "Company”` | **1.** [Get sub-accounts where app is installed](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-installed-location/index.html) **2.** [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token/index.html) for every location where app is installed **3.** Listen to [AppInstall webhook](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/AppInstall) event for automatic future installations or installs done as part of a SaaS plan, and [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token/index.html) for the newly installed locations. |
| Sub-account | Agency Only | Yes | Agency user installs the app | `“isBulkInstallation” : true`, `“userType" : "Company"` | **1.** [Get sub-accounts where app is installed](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-installed-location/index.html) **2.** [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token/index.html) for every location where app is installed **3.** Listen to [AppInstall webhook](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/AppInstall) event for automatic future installations or installs done as part of a SaaS plan, and [Get Location Token using Agency Token](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ghl/oauth/get-location-access-token/index.html) for the newly installed locations. |

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain the existing installation flow for legacy apps, mappings are set as follows:

| Legacy Distribution Type | Target User | Installer | Bulk-install | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agency Only | Agency | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Sub-account Only | Sub-account | Agency & Sub-account | No | Develop the token exchange mechanism for bulk-installation flow as mentioned above. Once done, set "Can the app be bulk-installed by agencies?" to "Yes" |
| Agency & Sub-account | Sub-account | Agency Only | Yes | To make the app accessible to sub-accounts, you must ensure the app does not require any agency-level access such as: Agency Level Scopes - companies.readonly, companies.write, location.write, saas/location.write, snapshots.readonly, snapshots.write, custom-menu-link.readonly, custom-menu-link.write. Module > Snapshots, Module > CustomJS. If your app does not require any of the above: 1. Develop the OAuth flow for installation by sub-account admins, which would generate a userType: Location token, as mentioned above. 2. Once done, change "Who can install the app?" to "Agency & sub-account" |

## Target User Types

### Target User: Agency

Choose this if your app is only relevant for agency-level accounts.

- **App Listing:** Only in agency Marketplace.
- **Installation:** Only agency admins/owners can install/uninstall.
- **Payments:** Agency bears cost for paid apps.
- **Re-selling:** Not available to sub-accounts.

---

### Target User: Sub-account — Both Can Install

Choose this if your app is for sub-account-level usage but should be installable by both agencies and sub-accounts.

- **App Listing:** Appears in both agency and sub-account Marketplaces.
- **Installation:** Both sub-account admins and agency admins can install.
- **Bulk Installation:** Supported if enabled. Agencies can auto-install to all sub-accounts.
- **Payments:** Sub-account pays for paid apps.
- **Re-selling:** Agencies can re-sell.

---

### Target User: Sub-account — Only Agency Can Install

Choose this if only agencies should install, but app is used at sub-account level.

- **App Listing:** Only in agency view.
- **Installation:** Agency admins/owners install/uninstall for sub-accounts.
- **Bulk Installation:** Supported if enabled.
- **Re-selling:** Agencies can re-sell with markup.
