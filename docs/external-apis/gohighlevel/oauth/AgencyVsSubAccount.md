# Understanding HighLevel’s Go-To-Market Model

HighLevel is not a standalone SaaS platform sold directly to end-users. Instead, our core customers are digital marketing agencies and consultants who:

- Purchase HighLevel licenses to power their portfolio of marketing, sales, and service tools.
- White-label the platform under their own branding and custom domains.
- Resell access and services built on HighLevel to their small-business clients.

As an app developer in the HighLevel ecosystem, it’s crucial to understand this multi-tiered relationship. Your app isn’t just being sold to an end business—it’s being sold to agencies, who then package and brand it before offering it to their clients.

## 1. Agencies as HighLevel’s Primary Customers

### License Holders

Agencies subscribe to HighLevel’s platform at the agency level. Each agency account can host multiple “sub-accounts” (often one per SMB client).

### Revenue Streams

- **Platform Subscription:** Agencies pay a monthly fee for HighLevel itself, often tiered by the number of sub-accounts or feature set.
- **App Marketplace Purchases:** Agencies can purchase third-party apps (built by you) on a per-sub-account or usage-based pricing model.
- **Add-On Services:** Some agencies offer managed services—campaign setup, consulting, or custom development—for additional fees.

### Scale Through Reselling

Agencies bundle your app’s functionality into their own service packages.

## 2. White-Labeling: Agencies as the Face of the Platform

HighLevel empowers agencies to present the platform—and any integrated apps—as their own proprietary software:

### Custom Branding

- **Logo & Color Scheme:** Agencies replace HighLevel’s default logo and colors with their own.
- **Email & SMS Sender IDs:** Messages are sent from the agency’s branded domains rather than HighLevel’s.

### Custom Domains

Every agency can map a domain or sub-domain (e.g., `crm.agencyname.com`) so that their clients never see HighLevel’s domain.

### UI Obfuscation

Core HighLevel footers, help links, and login screens can be rebranded or removed, further hiding HighLevel from the end client.

**Result:** SMB clients often believe they’re using the agency’s in-house platform rather than a third-party solution—and agencies control the entire client relationship.

## 3. What This Means for App Developers

### Your Buyer Is the Agency

- All communication, billing discussions, and support happen through the agency.
- Feature requests often come from agencies who want to bundle your app into their own service offerings.

### Revenue Share & Billing

- HighLevel handles billing directly with agencies, collects payment, then remits to you per agreed revenue-share terms.
- You’ll see payouts based on installations or usage by sub-accounts, but your contract is with HighLevel (the agency’s vendor).

## 4. Tips for Thriving in the HighLevel Ecosystem

- **Pricing Flexibility:** Support usage-based or per-sub-account plans so agencies can profitably resell to businesses of all sizes.
- **Agency-Centric Documentation:** Write your docs and tutorials with white-label protection in mind—show them how to train their clients quickly.
- **Co-Brandable Assets:** Provide white-label versions of screenshots, videos, and PDF one-pagers.
- **Develop White-Label Features:** If your app can inherit or respect the agency’s branding settings, it will integrate more seamlessly.
- **Partner Programs:** Consider running joint webinars or trainings with top HighLevel agencies to drive installs.

By understanding that agencies are both your direct customers and the gatekeepers to SMB end users, you can tailor your app's features, pricing, and marketing to align with their white-label reselling business model—and maximize adoption across the HighLevel network.
