# Step 2: Create a Marketplace App

This section walks you through creating a Marketplace App in HighLevel—from creating the app record in the Developer Portal, to completing your listing, generating OAuth credentials, and installing the app for testing.

## 1) Sign in to your Developer Account

1. Go to the [**HighLevel Marketplace**](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/) and sign in to your Developer Account.

2. After logging in, go to My Apps.

3. Click Create App.

That’s it — you’re now inside the app builder where you’ll configure everything.

---

## 2) Configure basic app details

When you create your app, HighLevel will ask for core setup details. These choices affect who can install the app and how it appears.

### App Name

- Choose a clear, descriptive name.
- This name is visible to users in the Marketplace (for **Public** apps).

### App Type: Private vs Public

#### Private App

- Intended for personal/internal use
- Not listed in the Marketplace
- Best for development/testing

#### Public App

- Listed in the Marketplace
- Installable by all users (once approved)

**Recommendation:**
 Start with **Private** while you build and test. Switch to **Public** only when your app is stable, secure, and ready for wider distribution.

### Target User

This defines who the app is built for (who will use it).

- **Recommended for most apps:** **Sub-account**
  - Works well for apps that operate at the individual location level.

### Who Can Install

Controls who can see/install your app in the Marketplace UI.

- **Recommended:** **Both Agency & Sub-account**
  - Maximizes visibility and adoption.
- **Agencies Only**
  - Useful if you’re building a fully white-labeled SaaS feature that agencies manage for their sub-accounts.

### Listing Type

- **White-label** is commonly recommended (especially for marketing agencies).
- This helps the app fit naturally into an agency’s branded experience.

## 3) Understand the app workspace

After you click **Create App**, you’ll land inside your app configuration area.

On the left navigation, you’ll see three major sections:

- **Build**
- **Manage**
- **Insights**

Think of them like this:

- **Build** = what the app is + how it behaves
- **Manage** = versions + credentials/secrets
- **Insights** = performance/usage visibility

---

## 4) Build section

### 4.1 Profile

The **Profile** is your Marketplace listing content — what users see before installing.

Typical profile fields include:

- App Logo
- Category
- Company Name
- App Description
- Preview Images / Screenshots

**Tip:** Don’t rush this section. Clear text + good visuals reduce confusion and increase installs.

### 4.2 Pricing

This is where you configure pricing for your app.

### 4.3 Modules

Marketplace Modules are feature “building blocks” you can enable inside a HighLevel Marketplace App to integrate with specific parts of HighLevel (UI + behavior), not just REST APIs.

### 4.4 Advanced Settings

This is where you configure the technical plumbing required for authentication and events, including:

- OAuth scopes
- Redirect URLs
- External Authentication
- Webhooks

Advanced Settings includes three key sub-sections:

#### A) Auth (Scopes + Redirect URLs)

**What are scopes?**
 Scopes define the level of access your app is requesting — what data it can read or actions it can perform.

**How to add scopes:**

1. Click the **Select Scope** dropdown.

2. Choose the scopes your app needs.

3. Use the documentation link in the UI to review the full scope list.

**Best practice:**
 Request the minimum scopes required. Fewer scopes = better security, more user trust, and typically a smoother approval process.

**What is a Redirect URL?**
 A Redirect URL (also called a Callback URL) is where HighLevel sends the authorization code after a user installs (or authorizes) your app.

**How to add a redirect URL:**

1. Enter your URL in the **Redirect URL** field.

2. Click **Add** to save it.

Your redirect URL should:

- Use **HTTPS**
- Be controlled by your backend (not a front-end-only page)
- Match exactly what your OAuth flow expects (even small differences can break installs)

#### B) Webhooks

HighLevel Marketplace allows you to subscribe to multiple webhook events.

In the **Webhooks** section:

- Add your **Webhook URL**
- HighLevel will send event notifications in real time to that endpoint

#### C) External Authentication

External Authentication allows developers to authenticate HighLevel users using the developer’s system before they install the application in HighLevel.

## 5) Manage section

### 5.1 Versions

Marketplace supports app versioning so you can create and manage new versions.

You’ll use this for:

- Releasing updates
- Testing changes safely
- Keeping stable versions available while you iterate

**Good habit:**
 Treat versions like real software releases. Track changes, test upgrades, and avoid breaking behavior without a migration plan.

### 5.2 Secrets (Client Keys + Shared Secret Key)

This section is where you generate and manage:

- **Client Keys** (Client ID + Client Secret)
- **Shared Secret Key** (used for secure user context access via signed tokens)

#### Client Keys: Generate Client ID & Client Secret

Client credentials identify and authenticate your app during the OAuth token exchange.

**How to generate them:**

1. In **Client Keys**, click **Add**

2. Provide a name for the client key pair

3. Save

HighLevel will generate:

- Client ID
- Client Secret

> ⚠️ **Important (don’t ignore this):**
 Copy and store your **Client Secret** immediately. Once you click **OK**, it will not be shown again. Treat it like a password.

#### Shared Secret Key (Signed token user context)

HighLevel provides a secure mechanism for accessing authenticated user information through signed tokens. The **Shared Secret Key** is used to verify/validate that secured context.

## 6) Insights section: adoption and usage visibility

Insights is used for visibility into:

- performance
- installs
- usage metrics
