#### Securing your Delivery URL

POSTs to your **Delivery URL** are signed like platform webhooks. Follow the same verification steps as the [Webhook Integration Guide](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/WebhookIntegrationGuide#security-verifying-webhook-authenticity):

- **Header:** `X-GHL-Signature` (Ed25519) — **sent** on Delivery URL posts.
- **Not sent:** `X-WH-Signature` (legacy RSA) — used on some OAuth app webhooks only.

Details, public key, and sample code: [Provider Outbound Message — Security: Verifying Webhook Authenticity](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/ProviderOutboundMessage#security-verifying-webhook-authenticity).

Outbound Message Events [https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/OutboundMessage](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/OutboundMessage)

## Additional Notes

### Using Providers

1. Conversations Screen - Navigate to the conversations screen to send/receive messages if a provider is set as the default or if you have enabled the ability to see the provider.

2. Bulk Actions - Only supported on default providers at this time.

3. Workflows - Review notes on currently supported modules.

4. Mobile Application - Select your custom provider depending on type.

5. All installed custom conversation providers in a sub-account appear under Settings > Conversation Providers; SMS and Email type providers can be used to send and receive messages directly from the CRM, while Call providers cannot be used to place or receive calls within the CRM and can only be used to log calls via inbound and outbound apis.

### Update Message Status API

Message status updates are only able to be updated by the conversation provider marketplace application tokens. If you have additional marketplace applications installed in your account then they cannot update the message status.
